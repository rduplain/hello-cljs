## Hello ClojureScript

[![Build Status][build]](https://travis-ci.org/rduplain/hello-cljs)


### Overview

This project demonstrates tooling for ClojureScript with workflows appropriate
to Unix tradition with a build oriented toward general-purpose programming
(with Node.js, and not the browser). **Build redistributable native binaries
with ClojureScript and npm libraries.**

While Java is a dependency of Clojure, this project focuses exclusively on
building ClojureScript for Node.js. The same workflow applies to other
JavaScript targets, namely the browser, if the Clojure deps and npm packages
support the runtime. The redistributable binary only applies with a Node.js
target, but this workflow can produce a .js file suitable for other JavaScript
targets.

Of particular note, both Clojure and JavaScript have many options available to
build a project. This demonstration project arrives at many decisions aligned
with Unix expectations:

* Use [Clojure command line tools][clojure cli] directly, with deps.edn.
* Use [Node.js and npm][node.js] directly, with package.json.
* Use [shadow-cljs][shadow-cljs] to build .js from deps.edn and `node_modules`.
* Use [pkg][pkg] to build binaries from `node_modules` and the built .js file.
* Use a Makefile ([GNU Make][make]) to provide a simple developer workflow.

### Dependencies

Development:

* [Clojure command line tools][clojure cli]. Tested with Clojure v1.9.0.
* [Node.js and npm][node.js]. Tested with Node.js v10.14.0 and npm v6.5.0.
* [GNU Make][make]. Available on most Unix systems. Tested with GNU Make v3.81.
* A Unix system such as GNU/Linux or Mac OS X.

**Production has no dependencies. The redistributable binaries run natively on
GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, respectively.**


### Workflow

Development:

* `make` -- Test, build binaries, and test platform binary (`make release`).
* `make bin` -- Create redistributable binaries.
* `make build` -- Build the ClojureScript project into a single .js file.
* `make install` -- Install packages; this is run automatically.
* `make outdated` -- Check for outdated packages.
* `make release` -- Test, build binaries, and test platform binary.
* `make repl` -- Run a ClojureScript repl. (Use an IDE instead, below.)
* `make test-refresh` -- Run project tests and watch for changes.
* `make test` -- Run project tests.

To build a binary for FreeBSD, set up a development environment and run `make
release-for-os` on a FreeBSD system, with resulting binary at `./target/hello`.


Production:

* After running `make`, find redistributable binaries in `./target/bin-*/`.
* The redistributable binaries run natively without dependencies on GNU/Linux,
  Mac OS X, and Windows, respectively.
* The binaries include their own Node.js runtime and therefore are relatively
  large (tens of megabytes) compared to other system executables.
* If needed, these binaries compress by a factor of 3 with `bzip2`. A release
  step could publish compressed binaries with an install step which
  decompresses and puts the binary on the PATH.


### Integrated Development Environment

Run `M-x cider-jack-in` from Emacs with [CIDER][cider], using `shadow-cljs` as
the command. Once loaded, in the CIDER clj repl, start a CLJS repl with:

```clojure
(require '[shadow.cljs.devtools.api :as shadow])
(shadow/node-repl :app)
```

Note that shadow-cljs [has a fake piggieback][shadow-cljs fake piggieback]; use
the shadow-cljs snippet above in a clj repl to create the cljs repl instead of
using `M-x cider-jack-in-cljs`. Alternatively, load the snippet above into a
custom cljs repl type in CIDER with its `cider-register-cljs-repl-type`
function and use `M-x cider-jack-in-cljs` on that newly registered type.

While `cider-connect` is available, the available tools are best run separately
as to allow repl interactions separately from the build process. Start this
CIDER repl before starting any other shadow-cljs process.

### Using `npm` Packages

[shadow-cljs][shadow-cljs] loads any module found in the `node_modules`
directory. See [this guide][shadow-cljs npm] for example require forms.

### Using Macros

Keep in mind that [ClojureScript has differences][clojurescript differences]
from Clojure:

> ClojureScriptâ€™s macros must be defined in a different _compilation stage_
> than the one from where they are consumed. One way to achieve this is to
> define them in one namespace and use them from another.

To use a macro in a ClojureScript project, define the macro in a .clj or .cljc
file. In a cljs `(ns ...)` form, reference macros with the `(:require-macros
...)` form, which has the same format as `(:require ...)`. Note that
ClojureScript compiler `:optimizations` set to `:none` in development will
result in Node.js loading separate files. In effect, this means that any
namespace references in a macro will not be automatically brought forward when
requiring the macro during a repl session or when tests are running (unless
using shadow-cljs `release` subcommand to compile the tests into a single
file), and names will not resolve and will be undefined in the resulting
macro-expanded code.

In development:

* In the repl, load the requisite macro definition and its `require` calls.
* In the cljs test matching the macro definition, require the namespaces which
  will allow the expanded macro to fully resolve its references.

These steps are only needed in development; the production build compiles a
single .js and Node.js will find the relevant references.

### Wishlist

* `make clj-outdated` has a [unix exit code][depot exit].
* `clj -Stree` has [a --depth option][tools deps tree cli], similar to npm ls.
